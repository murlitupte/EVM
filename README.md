All about the course first Metacrafters ↓↓

It was designed to introduce about Web3 and also get started with solidity programming.With that also get a challenge to complete for improve my skills.


## Explaining Task
I had a challenge to make a contract on the basis to mint and burn the token, where I make a three variable : two strings and one uint
1. Strings as tokenname with a value of "boss"
2. Strings as tokenabbr (Abbreviation) with a value of "joseph"
3. uint as a totalsupply (Which I set as to be zero)

### RuN the setup
* Here I used Online Remix IDE Compiler for writing the code.
* Then I created a file which is present in the repository named as tokencreate.sol .

### Execution
* If you are using Remix IDE, you can simply compile the code with the help of compile option present at a Menu Bar.
* After compiling, you have to deploy the Contract from the side bar itself. And after deploying you have to enter some inputs which is require to the smart contract.

## My Experience
After completing this course I would say it was totally worth to get it and also say that if you want to know about web3 then must visit.
